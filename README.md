# Multimodal Learning inspired by Multitask learning in Video Emotion Recognition

## Introduction

This is my on-going project. I use the idea of Multitask learning for Multimodal learning. In our proposed methods, we utilize the idea of multitask learning for multimodal learning. In multitask learning, a prediction of a task can improve the accuracy of the prediction of another task. For multimodal learning, we aim to use a prediction generated from a specific modal to enhance the prediction obtained from another modal or a prediction of the late-fusion production.

## Dataset

We conducted the experiments on the reorganized IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI provided by [Dai](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.417/), and the [CH-SIMS dataset](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.343/). The preprocessed IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/wenliangdai/Multimodal-End2end-Sparse). The CH-SIMS and its baseline can be found [here](https://github.com/thuiar/MMSA). For all datasets, we used the MTCNN to extract facial images and resized to 260x260.
